I'm Peyman and I'm a full-stack web developer for more than 4 years. I implement websites with ASP.NET Core MVC, and with custom programming(both front-end and back-end of the website).
I usually upload the source codes of my projects on github and if you'd like to know more about meand my portfolio please check my website https://peymanakhtari.com
